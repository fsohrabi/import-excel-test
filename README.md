# Employee Test Project

This project utilizes Laravel, Queues, Laravel Excel, and MySQL to accomplish the required tasks.

## Commands

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Create a database named `localbrand` in your MySQL server.
   
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p -e "CREATE DATABASE localbrand;"
   ```
   
2. Run the migrations to create the necessary database tables.
   
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

3. Start the development server.
   
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

4. Run the queue worker to process queued jobs.
   
   ```bash
   php artisan queue:work --queue=high,default
   ```

Now, you can access the project on your local host.

## Additional Information

In this project, we have utilized jobs to handle time-consuming tasks asynchronously. This ensures that users don't experience delays while performing operations such as importing Excel files.

### Handling Large Excel Files

When dealing with large Excel files, it's essential to split them into smaller files for easier processing. For instance, if a file exceeds one million rows, dividing it into smaller files can facilitate efficient processing. This segmentation allows for parallel processing and prevents overwhelming the system.
It's crucial to consider CPU and memory usage. Laravel Excel helps in handling large files efficiently by utilizing chunking, dividing the work into smaller parts to prevent overwhelming the system.

### Caching Layers

In larger projects, implementing caching layers before database operations can enhance system stability. By utilizing caching mechanisms, such as Redis or Memcached, repetitive and resource-intensive database queries can be avoided, reducing the risk of system crashes.

### Writing Unit Tests

While endpoint tests are crucial for API testing, adding more unit tests can further enhance code quality. Adopting Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices enables developers to write more comprehensive unit tests, ensuring better code coverage and overall system reliability.

Moreover, it's essential to implement authentication in real-world projects to ensure data security and user privacy.

In summary, this README covers the setup process and additional considerations for handling real-world project efficiently in a Laravel project.
